# Image_Editor

This application was developed using Java Swing and allows to: 
- load images into tabs: "copy from" & "copy to"
- highlight any part of loaded image from "copy from" tab
- copy that part into clipboard (and/or save it as a separate .png file on the hard disk), from where it can be pasted again into "copy from" tab
  or "copy to" tab, if there is an image already loaded into this tab
- clippings from the clipboard, when pasted into "copy from" tab can be used, to highlight a part of them and 
  copy into the clipboard again
- when a clipping is pasted into "copy to" tab - it can be rotated, resized, and embedded into 
  another image and then saved as a png file
